# Technical Specification: Protocol-Driven Accounting Automation System

## Section 1: System Architecture and Core Principles

This document provides the definitive architectural specification for an automated accounting data processing system. It is intended for the engineering team responsible for its implementation, offering a comprehensive blueprint that details component design, system flow, and foundational principles.

### 1.1 Executive Summary and System Mission

The primary mission of this system is to provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable platform for automating the extraction and categorization of financial data from receipt images. By ingesting digital images of receipts, the system will orchestrate an AI-powered analysis to extract structured data, which will then be dynamically and accurately persisted into a designated Notion database. This automation aims to eliminate error-prone manual data entry, accelerate accounting workflows, and create a reliable, structured data repository for financial records.

The architecture is built upon several key pillars:

  * **Asynchronous Processing:** To ensure a responsive and resilient user experience, time-intensive operations are offloaded to a background processing queue, preventing the main API from being blocked.
  * **Decoupled Services:** Components are designed with clear boundaries and communicate through well-defined interfaces, promoting modularity and independent scalability.
  * **AI-Centric Logic:** A core innovation, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), is implemented entirely within an N8N workflow. This allows an AI Agent to dynamically analyze the target database schema and intelligently map extracted receipt data to the correct fields, providing unparalleled flexibility without requiring code changes for new database layouts.

### 1.2 Architectural Blueprint

The system comprises five primary components interacting in a well-defined, event-driven sequence. The flow is designed for high throughput, fault tolerance, and a clear separation of responsibilities, with the N8N workflow serving as the central intelligence hub.

The logical architecture is illustrated as follows:

1.  **Client:** Any user-facing application (e.g., web front-end, mobile app) capable of making an HTTP `multipart/form-data` request. The client initiates the process by uploading a receipt image and providing the unique identifier for the target Notion database.
2.  **FastAPI Backend (API Service):** This is the synchronous gateway to the system. Built with Python and FastAPI, it is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, performing initial validation, and delegating the core processing task to the asynchronous backend. It immediately returns a job identifier to the client, confirming receipt of the request.
3.  **Redis:** This high-performance in-memory data store serves a dual purpose. It acts as the message broker for the Redis Queue (`rq`), providing a persistent queue for jobs to be processed.[1] It also provides the backbone for the `rq` worker infrastructure, ensuring that tasks are not lost if a service restarts.[2]
4.  **RQ Worker (Trigger Service):** This is a lightweight asynchronous service. Running as a separate process, it pulls jobs from the Redis queue. Its sole responsibility is to trigger the N8N workflow via a webhook, passing along the image data and the target Notion database ID.
5.  **N8N Workflow (Core Intelligence):** This is the brain of the operation, an automated workflow that executes the entire business process [23, 24]:
      * **Receives Trigger:** A webhook node starts the workflow when called by the RQ Worker.
      * **Executes MCP:** It implements the Model Context Protocol by calling the Notion API to retrieve the live schema of the target database.
      * **AI Analysis:** An AI Agent node uses a vision model to analyze the receipt image, extracting key financial data.[25, 26, 27]
      * **Intelligent Mapping:** The same AI Agent uses the extracted data and the retrieved Notion schema to dynamically construct the final JSON payload required to create a new Notion page.
      * **Data Persistence:** It calls the Notion API to write the new record to the database.
      * **Callback:** It makes a final API call back to the FastAPI service to report the job's success or failure.

The end-to-end data flow proceeds as follows:

  * A client POSTs a receipt image and `notion_database_id` to the FastAPI `/upload` endpoint.
  * The FastAPI service validates the request and enqueues a job in Redis with a unique `job_id`. It immediately responds to the client with this `job_id`.
  * An available RQ Worker picks up the job from the Redis queue.
  * The worker triggers the N8N workflow via a webhook, passing the image data and `notion_database_id`.
  * The N8N workflow begins execution:
    1.  It uses the `notion_database_id` to fetch the database's schema from the Notion API.
    2.  It passes the receipt image and the schema to an AI Agent.
    3.  The AI Agent extracts data from the image and, using the schema as context, builds the correct JSON payload for a new Notion page.
    4.  The workflow sends this payload to the Notion API, creating the record.
  * Upon completion, the N8N workflow makes a POST request to the FastAPI `/callback` endpoint, providing the final status of the job.
  * The FastAPI service logs this final status to a persistent database for auditing.

### 1.3 Foundational Design Principles

The system's design is governed by a set of strict principles intended to maximize correctness, maintainability, and long-term scalability. These are not mere suggestions but core requirements that inform all implementation decisions.

#### 1.3.1 Declarative and Strongly-Typed Approach

The entire Python codebase will strictly adhere to modern, strongly-typed Python conventions, leveraging the `typing` module extensively. Every function signature, variable, and class attribute will have an explicit type hint. This declarative style makes the code's intent unambiguous and enables static analysis tools like `mypy` to verify type correctness before runtime, catching a significant class of potential bugs early in the development cycle.[3, 4] This approach transforms the code into a more self-documenting and reliable asset.

#### 1.3.2 Protocol-Driven Development

Interfaces between system components will be defined using `typing.Protocol`. This enforces structural subtyping, or "static duck typing," which is a highly Pythonic way to define contracts.[3, 5] A class does not need to explicitly inherit from a protocol to be considered a valid implementation; it only needs to match the specified structure.[4, 6] This approach promotes loose coupling and is the philosophical underpinning of the Model Context Protocol, which is realized within the N8N workflow.

#### 1.3.3 Separation of Concerns (SoC)

The project will follow a well-defined structure that enforces a strict separation of concerns, a best practice for scalable FastAPI applications.[7, 8, 9] This is achieved by organizing the code into distinct layers:

  * **API/Routing Layer:** Handles HTTP request/response logic only.
  * **Service Layer:** Contains the business logic for enqueuing tasks.
  * **Domain Layer:** Defines the core data structures and schemas for API I/O.
  * **Infrastructure Layer:** Encapsulates all interactions with external systems (databases, message queues).

This separation ensures that changes in one part of the system have minimal impact on the others.

#### 1.3.4 Asynchronous and Decoupled by Default

The architecture is fundamentally asynchronous. The user-facing API is designed to be highly responsive by offloading any operation that could introduce latency. The choice to use `rq` and Redis for background task management is central to this principle.[1, 10] This decouples the immediate task of accepting a user's request from the longer, more complex, and potentially fallible process of AI analysis and external API interaction.[11, 12] This decoupling not only improves user experience but also enhances system resilience and scalability.

### 1.4 The Strategic Value of a Prescriptive Style Guide

The explicit mandate for a "declarative, strongly-typed, protocol-driven" programming style is the most significant constraint on this project, and it reflects a mature understanding of the challenges in building and maintaining large-scale software. This is not a stylistic preference but a strategic choice aimed at ensuring long-term system health.

By mandating strong typing and protocols, the system design shifts the burden of correctness checking from runtime to "compile-time" (i.e., the static analysis phase). A function signature like `def enqueue_receipt_task(file: UploadFile, notion_database_id: str) -> JobID:` is completely unambiguous. It declares its dependencies and their expected behavior. A static type checker can verify that any object passed conforms to the required types.[5] This creates a powerful safety net.

This prescriptive approach yields several compounding benefits:

  * **Enhanced Maintainability:** The code becomes largely self-documenting.
  * **Improved Team Scalability:** Clear, enforced contracts make it easier for multiple developers to work on different parts of the system concurrently.
  * **Reduced Bugs:** A significant percentage of common programming errors (e.g., `TypeError`, `AttributeError`) are caught before the code is ever run.
  * **Safer Refactoring:** IDEs and static analysis tools can more reliably perform automated refactoring when types are known.

Therefore, while this style may introduce a degree of verbosity compared to traditional dynamic Python, it is an investment that pays substantial dividends in system robustness, developer productivity, and the overall longevity of the application.

## Section 2: Backend Service Implementation (FastAPI)

This section details the architecture and implementation of the backend API service. This service acts as the primary, synchronous entry point for all client interactions, built upon the FastAPI framework for its high performance and native support for modern Python features.

### 2.1 Project Structure

To ensure maintainability and enforce the principle of Separation of Concerns, the project will adopt a modular directory structure designed to scale effectively.[7, 8, 13]

The proposed directory structure is as follows:

```
accounting_service/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── v1/

│   └──...
├──.env                         # Environment variables file
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

This organization cleanly separates API definitions (`api/`) from business logic (`services/`), domain models (`domain/`), and external integrations (`infrastructure/`), creating a clean, testable, and scalable architecture.[9]

### 2.2 API Endpoint Specification

The system exposes two primary API endpoints, each with a distinct responsibility in the workflow.

| Endpoint | Method | Request Body | Response Body | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/api/v1/receipts/upload` | `POST` | `multipart/form-data` | `JSON` | Accepts a receipt image and metadata, validates it, and enqueues a processing job. |
| `/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/callback` | `POST` | `JSON` | `JSON` | An internal endpoint for the N8N workflow to post the final result of a processing job. |

#### 2.2.1 Upload Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/receipts/upload`

This endpoint is the main entry point for users. It is designed to handle file uploads efficiently and asynchronously.

  * **Request Format:** The endpoint expects a `multipart/form-data` request.[14, 15] It will accept two fields:

      * `file`: The receipt image, handled by FastAPI as an `UploadFile` object.
      * `notion_database_id`: A string submitted as a form field (`Form(...)`) representing the target database in Notion.

  * **Validation:** Before accepting the file, the endpoint will perform several validation steps:

    1.  **File Presence and Type:** Use `Pillow` to confirm it is a valid image format and `python-magic` to verify its true MIME type.[15, 16]
    2.  **Size Limiting:** A maximum file size (e.g., 10 MB) will be enforced.

  * **Response:** Upon successful validation and job enqueueing, the API will immediately return a `202 Accepted` status code and a JSON response body:

    ```python
    # In app/domain/schemas.py
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    import uuid

    class JobCreationResponse(BaseModel):
        job_id: uuid.UUID
        status: str = "queued"
    ```

#### 2.2.2 Callback Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/callback`

This endpoint serves as a webhook target for the N8N workflow to report the outcome of a job.

  * **Request Format:** The endpoint expects a JSON payload defined by a Pydantic schema:
    ```python
    # In app/domain/schemas.py
    from typing import Optional

    class JobCallbackPayload(BaseModel):
        status: str  # e.g., "success", "failure"
        message: Optional[str] = None
        notion_page_url: Optional[str] = None
    ```
  * **Logic:** The endpoint will use the `job_id` to update the status of the corresponding job in the logging database.
  * **Security:** This endpoint must be secured with a static, shared secret token passed in an HTTP header.

### 2.3 Task Enqueueing Logic (`services/task_service.py`)

The `TaskService` bridges the synchronous API and the asynchronous processing world.

```python
# In app/services/task_service.py
from fastapi import UploadFile
from app.domain.schemas import JobCreationResponse
import uuid

class TaskService:
    def __init__(self, queue): # queue is an rq.Queue object
        self.queue = queue

    async def enqueue_receipt_task(
        self, file: UploadFile, notion_database_id: str
    ) -> JobCreationResponse:
        job_id = uuid.uuid4()
        image_bytes = await file.read()

        self.queue.enqueue(
            'rq_worker.trigger_n8n_workflow',
            job_id=job_id,
            image_bytes=image_bytes,
            notion_database_id=notion_database_id,
            filename=file.filename
        )

        return JobCreationResponse(job_id=job_id)
```

This service encapsulates the interaction with `rq`, keeping the API router clean.[2, 10]

### 2.4 The Duality of `UploadFile`

A critical implementation detail lies in how the `fastapi.UploadFile` object is handled. This object is a sophisticated file-like object designed for high-performance asynchronous web applications.[17, 18] The `rq` library's `enqueue` method, however, is synchronous and cannot serialize the complex `UploadFile` object.

The correct architectural pattern is to resolve the file's content within the asynchronous context of the API service call. The `TaskService` must first call `await file.read()`. This asynchronously reads the entire content of the file into a simple `bytes` object. This `bytes` object is easily and reliably serializable, ensuring the job payload sent to Redis is simple and self-contained.

## Section 3: Asynchronous Task Processing (RQ Worker)

The asynchronous task processing component is a lightweight trigger, fully decoupled from the user-facing API. Its sole purpose is to initiate the N8N workflow.[1, 10]

### 3.1 Worker Implementation (`rq_worker.py`)

The RQ worker is a standalone Python process that listens for jobs on a Redis queue, executed via the `rq` CLI tool.[1, 2]

A simplified structure for `rq_worker.py`:

```python
# In rq_worker.py
import os
import httpx
import base64
from redis import Redis
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection
from app.core.config import settings

listen = ['default']
redis_conn = Redis.from_url(settings.REDIS_URL)

def trigger_n8n_workflow(job_id: str, image_bytes: bytes, notion_database_id: str, filename: str):
    """
    The main task function executed by the RQ worker.
    It triggers the N8N workflow.
    """
    print(f"Triggering N8N for job {job_id}...")
    try:
        callback_url = f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/jobs/{job_id}/callback"
        n8n_payload = {
            "job_id": str(job_id),
            "image_data": base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode('utf-8'),
            "filename": filename,
            "notion_database_id": notion_database_id,
            "callback_url": callback_url
        }

        with httpx.Client() as client:
            response = client.post(
                settings.N8N_WEBHOOK_URL,
                json=n8n_payload,
                headers={"X-N8N-Api-Key": settings.N8N_API_KEY},
                timeout=30.0
            )
            response.raise_for_status()

        print(f"Job {job_id} successfully submitted to N8N.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error triggering N8N for job {job_id}: {e}")
        raise # Let RQ handle the failure

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(redis_conn):
        worker = Worker(map(Queue, listen))
        worker.work()
```

### 3.2 Orchestration Logic within the Worker

The `trigger_n8n_workflow` function is a simple orchestrator:

1.  **Receive Job Data:** It receives the deserialized arguments: `job_id`, `image_bytes`, and `notion_database_id`.
2.  **Construct N8N Payload:** It assembles a JSON payload for the N8N webhook, encoding the image in Base64 for safe transmission.
3.  **Trigger N8N Workflow:** It makes a secure HTTP POST request to the N8N webhook URL.
4.  **Exception Handling:** The process is wrapped in a `try...except` block. Re-raising the exception allows `rq` to move the failed job to a dedicated `failed` queue for later inspection.[1]

### 3.3 RQ vs. FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`

The choice of `rq` over FastAPI's built-in `BackgroundTasks` is a critical architectural decision for production systems.[11, 12] `BackgroundTasks` run in the same process as the web server and are lost if the server crashes or restarts.[11] `rq` provides a robust, production-grade solution by using an external Redis broker, which guarantees:

  * **Durability and Persistence:** Jobs are safely stored in Redis until a worker can process them.[1]
  * **True Decoupling:** Workers run in separate processes, preventing heavy loads from impacting API performance.
  * **Independent Scalability:** Worker capacity can be scaled independently of the web servers.
  * **Enhanced Observability:** Tools like `rq-dashboard` and the automatic creation of a "failed queue" (a Dead Letter Queue) are invaluable for monitoring and debugging.[10, 19]

## Section 4: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) in N8N

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is not a piece of Python code but an architectural pattern implemented entirely within the N8N workflow. It defines the process by which the workflow becomes "context-aware," enabling it to dynamically adapt to any Notion database schema without modification.

### 4.1 Protocol Definition

The MCP is a sequence of automated actions within N8N:

1.  **Ingest Identifier:** The workflow receives a unique identifier for a data target (e.g., a `notion_database_id`) from the incoming webhook.
2.  **Retrieve Schema:** The workflow uses the identifier to make an API call to the target service (Notion) to retrieve its structural schema.
3.  **Provide Context:** The retrieved schema is then passed as structured context to a subsequent AI Agent node.

This protocol decouples the AI's logic from any hardcoded knowledge of the database structure. The AI is given the rules (the schema) at runtime and can adapt its behavior accordingly.

### 4.2 MCP Implementation in N8N

The MCP is realized in the N8N workflow using two key nodes:

1.  **Schema Retrieval Node:** This step uses the `notion_database_id` to fetch the database schema. While N8N's native **Notion Node** can be used with the `Database > Get` operation [28, 29], the recommended approach for production is to use the generic **HTTP Request Node**.[30, 31, 32] This provides greater control, specifically allowing the `Notion-Version` header to be pinned (e.g., to `2022-06-28`), which is critical for preventing unexpected breakages from Notion API updates.[33] This node will make a `GET` request to `https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/{database_id}`.[34]

2.  **Context Injection:** The JSON output from the schema retrieval node, which contains the detailed `properties` object of the Notion database [34, 35], is then passed directly into the prompt of the main AI Agent node in the next step.

### 4.3 The MCP as an "Anti-Corruption Layer"

This N8N-based implementation of the MCP acts as a powerful "Anti-Corruption Layer." It isolates the core AI logic from the specific, and potentially verbose, data structures of the external Notion API.[34] The AI Agent doesn't need to be trained on Notion's API; it simply needs to be instructed on how to read the schema provided to it. This makes the workflow incredibly flexible. To support a different data store (e.g., Airtable), one would only need to swap out the schema retrieval node; the core AI Agent and its prompt would remain largely unchanged.

## Section 5: AI-Powered Data Extraction Workflow (N8N)

The N8N workflow is the intelligent core of the system, executing a multi-step process to analyze, map, and persist the accounting data.

### 5.1 Workflow Design

The workflow is a linear sequence of nodes, each performing a specific task.

1.  **Webhook Trigger:** The workflow starts when it receives a `POST` request from the `rq_worker`. It ingests the payload containing `job_id`, `image_data`, `notion_database_id`, and `callback_url`.

2.  **MCP: Get Notion Schema:** An **HTTP Request Node** executes the first part of the MCP, calling the Notion API's `GET /v1/databases/{database_id}` endpoint to retrieve the schema.[34]

3.  **AI Agent: Analyze, Map, and Generate:** This is the most critical step, using an **AI Agent** or **OpenAI Node** configured with a vision-capable model like GPT-4o.[36, 37, 26, 27] This node is given a complex, multi-part prompt and two primary inputs:

      * The `image_data` from the trigger.
      * The `notion_schema` from the previous step.

    The prompt engineering for this node is paramount. It instructs the AI to perform a chain of reasoning:

    ```
    You are an expert accounting data extraction and mapping agent. Your task is to perform a three-step process:

    **Step 1: Extract Data from Image**
    Analyze the provided image of a receipt and extract the following key information: merchant name, transaction date, total amount, tax amount, and a list of line items.

    **Step 2: Analyze Target Schema**
    You have been provided with a JSON object representing the schema of a Notion database. Analyze its 'properties' to understand the available fields, their names, and their data types (e.g., 'title', 'number', 'date', 'select').

    **Step 3: Map and Generate Final Payload**
    Using the data extracted from the receipt in Step 1, create a valid JSON payload to create a new page in the Notion database defined by the schema from Step 2. Match the extracted data to the most appropriate fields in the schema. Format the data precisely according to the Notion API requirements for each property type. For example, a 'date' field requires an object like `{"date": {"start": "YYYY-MM-DD"}}`.

    Your final output MUST be only the single, valid JSON payload for the Notion API's 'POST /v1/pages' endpoint. Do not include any other text or explanation.
    ```

    This prompt leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities to perform not just extraction, but also the dynamic mapping, effectively executing the most complex part of the business logic.[38, 39, 40]

4.  **Persist to Notion:** A final **HTTP Request Node** takes the JSON output from the AI Agent and makes a `POST` request to `https://api.notion.com/v1/pages`, creating the new entry in the database.

5.  **Callback:** Based on the success or failure of the previous node, the workflow branches to send a final status report to the `callback_url` using another **HTTP Request Node**.

## Section 6: Auditing and Operational Loop

This final phase of the workflow ensures the process is transactional and auditable by closing the loop with the backend service.

### 6.1 Callback and Logging

The N8N workflow's final action is to notify the FastAPI backend of the outcome using the provided `callback_url`.

  * **Success Path:** If the page was created successfully, the callback payload will be:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Receipt processed and saved to Notion.",
      "notion_page_url": "..." // The URL of the newly created Notion page
    }
    ```
  * **Failure Path:** If any step failed, the payload will contain an error status and message.

This callback mechanism is vital for providing end-to-end visibility into the status of each job.

### 6.2 Job Status Persistence (`infrastructure/logging_db.py`)

To provide a complete audit trail, the backend will maintain a simple logging database using **SQLModel**, which combines SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, aligning with the system's declarative philosophy.[20, 21]

A `JobLog` model will define the database table:

```python
# In app/infrastructure/logging_db.py
from typing import Optional
from sqlmodel import Field, SQLModel, create_engine
import uuid
import datetime

class JobLog(SQLModel, table=True):
    job_id: uuid.UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid.uuid4, primary_key=True)
    status: str = Field(index=True)
    filename: Optional[str] = None
    created_at: datetime.datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.datetime.utcnow)
    completed_at: Optional[datetime.datetime] = None
    result_message: Optional[str] = None
    notion_page_url: Optional[str] = None

sqlite_file_name = "job_logs.db"
sqlite_url = f"sqlite:///{sqlite_file_name}"
engine = create_engine(sqlite_url)

def create_db_and_tables():
    SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

When the FastAPI application starts, it creates this database and table.[21] The callback endpoint (`/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/callback`) will then find the `JobLog` record and update its status based on the payload from N8N, providing a durable, queryable record of every transaction.[22]

## Section 7: Deployment and Operational Considerations

Successfully deploying and operating this distributed system requires careful consideration of each component's lifecycle, configuration, and monitoring.

### 7.1 Component Deployment

  * **FastAPI Application:** Deployed as a containerized ASGI application using Uvicorn, running behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.
  * **RQ Worker:** Deployed as a separate, containerized process managed by a supervisor like `systemd` or as part of a Docker Compose or Kubernetes setup. This ensures the worker is automatically restarted if it fails.[2]
  * **Redis:** A managed Redis service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache, Redis Cloud) is strongly recommended for production to ensure high availability and data durability for the job queue.
  * **N8N:** Can be self-hosted using official Docker images for maximum control, or deployed via N8N's managed cloud service to offload operational overhead.

### 7.2 Configuration and Security

  * **Environment Variables:** All configuration, especially secrets like API keys and database URLs, must be managed through environment variables and loaded by a central config module.[7, 8]
  * **Webhook Security:** All public-facing webhooks must be secured. A shared secret token passed in a custom HTTP header is a simple and effective method.

### 7.3 Monitoring and Error Handling

  * **Structured Logging:** Both the FastAPI app and the RQ worker should use structured (JSON) logging for easy ingestion into monitoring platforms like Datadog or the ELK Stack.
  * **RQ Dashboard:** The `rq-dashboard-fast` library should be mounted in the FastAPI app to provide a real-time web UI for monitoring queue status, inspecting jobs, and retrying failed tasks.[10]
  * **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):** `rq`'s default behavior of moving failed jobs to a `failed` queue is a critical resilience pattern.[1, 19] This prevents a single "poison pill" job from blocking the entire queue and allows for offline analysis and manual intervention.
