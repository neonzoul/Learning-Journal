# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Protocol-Driven Accounting Automation System backend. The system is designed to automate the extraction and categorization of financial data from receipt images using AI-powered analysis, with the extracted data being persisted into a Notion database. The backend serves as the synchronous entry point and asynchronous task orchestrator for this workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Receipt Upload and Validation

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to upload receipt images with associated Notion database identifiers, so that the system can process them asynchronously and return immediate confirmation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to `/api/v1/receipts/upload` with multipart/form-data containing an image file and notion_database_id THEN the system SHALL validate the image format and size
2. WHEN the image validation passes THEN the system SHALL generate a unique job_id and enqueue the processing task
3. WHEN the task is successfully enqueued THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 202 Accepted with the job_id and status "queued"
4. WHEN an invalid image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the file size exceeds the maximum limit THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with HTTP 400

### Requirement 2: Asynchronous Task Processing

**User Story:** As the system, I want to process receipt analysis tasks asynchronously using Redis Queue, so that the API remains responsive and can handle multiple concurrent requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a receipt processing job is enqueued THEN the system SHALL use Redis Queue (RQ) to manage the task
2. WHEN an RQ worker picks up a job THEN it SHALL trigger the N8N workflow via HTTP webhook
3. WHEN triggering the N8N workflow THEN the worker SHALL encode the image data as base64 and include all necessary metadata
4. WHEN the N8N workflow call fails THEN the job SHALL be moved to the failed queue for later inspection
5. WHEN the worker process crashes THEN queued jobs SHALL persist in Redis and be processed when workers restart

### Requirement 3: Job Status Tracking and Callbacks

**User Story:** As the N8N workflow, I want to report job completion status back to the backend, so that the system maintains a complete audit trail of all processing activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the N8N workflow completes successfully THEN it SHALL POST to the callback endpoint with success status and Notion page URL
2. WHEN the N8N workflow fails THEN it SHALL POST to the callback endpoint with failure status and error message
3. WHEN a callback is received THEN the system SHALL authenticate it using a secret token in the request header
4. WHEN a valid callback is processed THEN the system SHALL update the job status in the logging database
5. WHEN an invalid callback token is provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 4: Data Persistence and Audit Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all job processing activities to be logged in a persistent database, so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new job is created THEN the system SHALL create an initial log entry with job_id, filename, and created_at timestamp
2. WHEN a job status is updated via callback THEN the system SHALL record the final status, completion time, and result details
3. WHEN querying job logs THEN the system SHALL provide indexed access by job_id and status
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically create the database tables if they don't exist
5. WHEN storing sensitive information THEN the system SHALL NOT log image data or API keys

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management and Security

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want all configuration to be managed through environment variables, so that the system can be deployed securely across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load all configuration from environment variables using Pydantic Settings
2. WHEN sensitive configuration is missing THEN the application SHALL fail to start with a clear error message
3. WHEN callback endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL be protected by secret token authentication
4. WHEN Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry logic
5. WHEN N8N webhook URLs are configured THEN they SHALL support HTTPS endpoints with proper SSL verification

### Requirement 6: Type Safety and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to use strong typing and protocol-driven design, so that the system is maintainable and less prone to runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing any function THEN it SHALL include explicit type hints for all parameters and return values
2. WHEN defining service interfaces THEN they SHALL use typing.Protocol for structural subtyping
3. WHEN creating data models THEN they SHALL use Pydantic BaseModel for validation and serialization
4. WHEN implementing dependency injection THEN it SHALL follow FastAPI's dependency system patterns
5. WHEN organizing code THEN it SHALL follow the specified directory structure with clear separation of concerns

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to monitor queue status and job processing metrics, so that I can ensure the system is operating correctly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FastAPI application is running THEN it SHALL expose an RQ Dashboard at `/rq` endpoint
2. WHEN jobs are processed THEN the system SHALL log structured information about job status and timing
3. WHEN jobs fail THEN they SHALL be moved to a failed queue with error details preserved
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN operators SHALL be able to view queue depth, worker status, and job history
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 8: Scalability and Performance

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the backend to support horizontal scaling and high throughput, so that it can handle increasing load as the system grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple API instances are deployed THEN they SHALL share the same Redis queue without conflicts
2. WHEN worker capacity needs to increase THEN additional RQ worker processes SHALL be deployable independently
3. WHEN processing large images THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without blocking other requests
4. WHEN under high load THEN the API SHALL remain responsive by offloading work to background processes
5. WHEN scaling components THEN each service SHALL be independently scalable without affecting others
